In this paper, we propose a new 3D holistic<sup>++</sup> scene understanding
problem, which jointly tackles two tasks from a single-view
image: (i) holistic scene parsing and reconstructionâ€”3D estimations
of object bounding boxes, camera pose, and room
layout, and (ii) 3D human pose estimation. The intuition behind
is to leverage the coupled nature of these two tasks to
improve the granularity and performance of scene understanding.
We propose to exploit two critical and essential
connections between these two tasks: (i) human-object interaction
(HOI) to model the fine-grained relations between
agents and objects in the scene, and (ii) physical commonsense
to model the physical plausibility of the reconstructed
scene. The optimal configuration of the 3D scene, represented
by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through
the non-differentiable joint solution space. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
improves the performance of the two tasks on three datasets,
showing an improved generalization ability.

# Usage
## Install
Support Python 3+.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data
1. Download the preprocessed data which contains the image and initialization from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBsGUSFze0z49iGTo2YBe_mx8P0h8S8I/view?usp=sharing"> here </a>, extract it with

        tar -vzxf data.tar.gz       

We will release more images from different dataset with initialization soon.
